### Meal Planner

## Motivation 

If you, like me, enjoy cooking and baking, you probably have your favorite recipes, those that became keepers and are always in the meals rotation in your household. So this app intends to create a place where you can save them, add your tweaks, and plan your weekly meal schedule!
